                        I recently completed my Ph.D. in East Asian studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (2025), 
                        where I also earned the Dr. Sandra J. Finley Teacher Scholar Certificate (2024), and am currently pursuing 
                        the LAS & OVCDEI Inclusive Pedagogy Certificate (expected 2026). In 2018, I attended the Winter School in 
                        the History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Sydney. My academic training combines historical 
                        research with a strong commitment to inclusive and effective teaching.
                    <br><br>
                        My research explores the intersection of crime, law, and medicine in late imperial China, with a focus on how judicial 
                        and medical authorities constructed, institutionalized, and regulated madness under the Qing dynasty. I am currently 
                        developing a book manuscript titled Legal Justice, Medical Authority, and Madness in China, 1600-1930, and conducting 
                        comparative studies on Euro-Asian histories of insanity, doctor-patient relationships, Manchu medical texts, and the 
                        pharmaceutical industry in East Asia. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation and the Illinois 
                        Global Institute at the University of Illinois.
                    <br><br>
                        At UIUC, I teach surveys of modern and contemporary East Asia, premodern China, and upper-level seminars on history of 
                        medicine in China, and Qing China.
