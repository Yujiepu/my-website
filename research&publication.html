                        I am a historian of law and medicine in late imperial China. With a focus on the legitimacy of knowledge, my research demonstrates 
                        how medical knowledge and practice were applied to clarify uncertain questions of illness‚Äîparticularly madness‚Äîwithin judicial settings. 
                        My dissertation, ‚ÄúLegal Justice, Medical Authority, and Madness in Qing China,‚Äù argues that the medico-legal interface, revolving around 
                        an emerging legal category of madness, was central to adjudicating madness from the late seventeenth to the early twentieth century. 
                        Drawing on more than 2,000 criminal cases in the First Historical Archives of China, alongside medical texts, government reports, 
                        administrative handbooks, and newspapers, I analyze how medico-legal interactions‚Äîbefore and after the arrival of Western medicine 
                        and psychiatry‚Äîshaped the adjudication of murder cases where defendants claimed innocence on grounds of madness. 
                        <br><br>
                        My book manuscript examines how Qing officials determined culpability and intent in cases of madness, an elusive and unstable condition 
                        that defied classification. It argues that during the eighteenth century, the Qing state selectively recognized Chinese medical reasoning 
                        as legally actionable knowledge in madness investigation. This gave rise to a distinctive medico-legal framework that was later reshaped 
                        in the early nineteenth century and ultimately overwritten during the legal reforms of the early twentieth century. This framework emerged 
                        through a contingent process shaped by bureaucratic prudence, evidentiary norms, and the adjudicative framework of qing-li-fa‚Äîpublic 
                        sentiment, moral reasoning, and statutory law. Within this context, madness was understood as a chronic yet treatable condition caused 
                        by emotional disturbance and bodily dysfunction.
                        <br><br>
                        By reconstructing how eighteenth-century state officials integrated medicine into the governance of madness, my research demonstrates 
                        that the criminal justice was shaped as much from the bottom up as from the center down. Local practitioners‚Äô practical experiences 
                        played an active role in legal reasoning, reshaping the practice of justice and reframing both the history of Chinese medicine and the 
                        history of criminal law. Madness adjudication thus reveals a medically informed institutional transformation that unfolded well before 
                        the introduction of Western psychiatry into China. Extending into the early twentieth century, the shift from ‚Äúmadness‚Äù to ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù 
                        in the new criminal code of Qing China exposes how the imperial state improvised a new legal category to preserve authority amid epistemic 
                        uncertainty and redefined what counted as legitimate knowledge. This trajectory highlights a distinctive form of Chinese legal modernity 
                        and challenges Euro-American centered theories of medicine and politics.
                        <br><br>
                        My dissertation forms part of a broad research agenda on medico-legal interactions and medical pluralism, addressing scholarly audiences 
                        in Chinese history, Japanese history and medical humanities, while also contributing to broader conversations in global and comparative 
                        histories of medicine. My first article, published in Medical Humanities, examines how the biomedicalization of aging in postwar Japan 
                        pathologized old age, while also showing the older adults‚Äô active role in shaping their healthcare experiences. A second article, 
                        currently undergoing revision and scheduled for resubmission to Late Imperial China in October 2025, turns to eighteenth-century murder 
                        cases in which defendants asserted their innocence due to mental derangement, demonstrating the crucial role of medical assessments in 
                        Qing capital review procedures. I am also contributing an invited book chapter on forensic medicine for the Cambridge History of Medicine, 
                        vol.3 (1450-1700), under contract with Cambridge University Press, which demonstrates the recognition of my research within global histories 
                        of medicine.
